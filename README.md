**Max Out Your Perception: A Totally Tubular Guide to AI Detection**

---

## ⚡ WHAT'S THE VIBE? ⚡

Welcome to the **SynthSense** repository! Come on in, take a look around!

Forget the boring lecture—this is an interactive guide and quiz module designed to power up your skills in spotting the flaws and glitches in AI-Generated Videos and deepfakes.

We've wrapped the whole protocol in a killer **cute retro cyberwaves** aesthetic. 
Think neon grids, chunky pixel type, and all the vaporwave vibes you can handle. No bots allowed!

## 🚀 GET INTERACTIVE!

The best part of this project is the interactive quiz (hello, working radio buttons!). 
You **need to hit the live GitHub Pages link** to access the full module and actually take the test:

## 💡 WHAT YOU'RE GONNA CHECK

This guided presentation walks you through the core technical and visual methods for calling out a deepfake:

* **Physics Flaws:** Gravity doesn't lie, even in the future.
* **Uncanny Valley:** Spotting the *almost* human.
* **Movement Glitches:** When the body language is totally bogus.
* **SIFT Method & Emotional Hook:** The deep dive into digital fakery.

## 📁 REPO FILES

This is a static content repository, meaning it just holds the website files that render the live presentation:

* `index.html`: The file containing the **Canva Smart Embed code**. This is what makes the quiz interactive on the live site.
* `README.md`: You are literally reading this right now, my fine feathered friend.
